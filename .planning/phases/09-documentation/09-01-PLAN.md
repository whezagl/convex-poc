**Tech stack available:** TypeScript, Claude Agent SDK, Convex (via Docker)
**Established patterns:**
- BaseAgent abstract class with SDK hooks for Convex integration
- Sequential orchestration with filesystem state passing (plan.json → code.json → review.json)
- Agent specialization (Planner, Coder, Reviewer) with typed result interfaces
- JSON artifact persistence for inspection and debugging
- Optional Convex workflow tracking

**Key files to reference:**
- src/agents/BaseAgent.ts - Base agent pattern
- src/orchestrator/SequentialOrchestrator.ts - Orchestration pattern
- src/types/plan.ts, src/types/code.ts, src/types/review.ts - Result interfaces
- examples/real-example.ts - Complete workflow demonstration

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Pattern Guide Documentation</name>
  <files>.planning/PATTERNS.md</files>
  <action>Create PATTERNS.md documenting reusable multi-agent coordination patterns established in this project:

1. **Pattern 1: BaseAgent Abstract Class**
   - Purpose: Reusable Claude SDK + Convex integration
   - Key features: SessionStart/SessionEnd hooks, automatic state tracking
   - How to extend: Implement getSystemPrompt() only
   - Location: src/agents/BaseAgent.ts

2. **Pattern 2: Sequential Orchestration**
   - Purpose: Multi-agent coordination pipeline
   - Flow: Planner → Coder → Reviewer
   - State passing: Filesystem artifacts (plan.json, code.json, review.json)
   - Location: src/orchestrator/SequentialOrchestrator.ts

3. **Pattern 3: Agent Specialization**
   - Purpose: Distinct responsibilities for different tasks
   - PlannerAgent: Task decomposition with PlanResult
   - CoderAgent: Implementation with CodeResult
   - ReviewerAgent: Validation with ReviewResult
   - Each agent has typed interface and execute method

4. **Pattern 4: Typed Result Interfaces**
   - Purpose: Predictable, structured agent output
   - PlanResult: steps, dependencies, duration
   - CodeResult: changes (FileChange[]), summary
   - ReviewResult: issues (ReviewIssue[]), overallStatus

5. **Pattern 5: Filesystem State Management**
   - Purpose: Artifact inspection and debugging
   - JSON artifacts in workspace directory
   - Each artifact validated by verify-output.ts
   - Enables workflow inspection without database

Include code examples for each pattern and migration guidance for using these patterns in new projects.

  <name>Task 2: Clean Up Placeholder Code</name>
  <files>src/convex/client.ts</files>
  <action>Clean up placeholder Convex client:
1. Update header comment to reflect current state (POC complete, placeholder for future Convex integration)
2. Add TODO comment noting this is intentional placeholder for future self-hosted Convex deployment
3. Ensure no commented-out code remains
4. Keep placeholder implementation as-is (it's correct for POC state)

The placeholder is intentional - Convex integration designed but not deployed for this POC. Documentation should clarify this is a design choice, not incomplete work.

  <verify>src/convex/client.ts has clear documentation that placeholder is intentional for POC scope</verify>
  <done>client.ts header comment updated to clarify placeholder is intentional (Convex designed but not deployed for POC)</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update Project README with Completion Status</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>Update README.md to reflect project completion:
1. Update "What This Project Demonstrates" section to emphasize this is a completed POC
2. Add "Project Status: Complete" badge/indicator near top
3. Update "Documentation" section to include PATTERNS.md reference
4. Add "What Was Built" summary section highlighting:
   - Multi-agent orchestration system (Planner → Coder → Reviewer)
   - SequentialOrchestrator for workflow coordination
   - Three specialized agents with typed interfaces
   - Filesystem-based state passing
   - Comprehensive examples and verification tools
   - 126+ passing tests
5. Add "Learning Outcomes" section briefly noting what patterns were established
6. Ensure all installation/quick start links are accurate
7. Add note about Convex placeholder being intentional for POC scope

Keep README concise but comprehensive. Link to PATTERNS.md for detailed pattern documentation.

2. **Delivered Features**: Bullet list of all working components
3. **Metrics**: 9 phases, 11 plans, 10 avg minutes/plan, 110 total execution time
4. **Key Decisions Summary**: Reference PROJECT.md decisions table
5. **Patterns Established**: Link to PATTERNS.md
6. **Testing**: 126+ tests passing, coverage notes
7. **Documentation**: Links to all README files and examples
8. **Future Work**: Optional enhancements (not required for POC)
   - Real Convex deployment
   - Additional agent types
   - Parallel orchestration
   - Workflow visualization UI

Keep it concise - this is a celebration document, not a technical spec. Reference other docs for details.
