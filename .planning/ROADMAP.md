# Roadmap: AI Agents POC

## Overview

A journey from blank TypeScript project to a working multi-agent autonomous coding system. We'll build a clean implementation of the Planner → Coder → Reviewer pattern using Claude Agent SDK, demonstrating agent coordination with reusable patterns for future projects.

## Domain Expertise

None - Claude Agent SDK patterns are the focus, and this is a learning POC to establish those patterns.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [ ] **Phase 1: Project Setup** - TypeScript project structure with Claude SDK integration
- [ ] **Phase 2: Agent Foundation** - Base agent abstraction and session management
- [ ] **Phase 3: Planner Agent** - Task decomposition and planning logic
- [ ] **Phase 4: Coder Agent** - Code implementation with file operations
- [ ] **Phase 5: Reviewer Agent** - Validation and quality checks
- [ ] **Phase 6: Orchestration** - Agent handoff patterns and workflow coordination
- [ ] **Phase 7: Example Task** - End-to-end demonstration with a simple coding task
- [ ] **Phase 8: Documentation** - Pattern documentation and cleanup

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Project Setup
**Goal**: TypeScript project with Claude SDK configured and build pipeline working
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Research**: Likely (Claude SDK current patterns, TypeScript project structure)
**Research topics**: @anthropic-ai/sdk current API, project structure for agent systems
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 2: Agent Foundation
**Goal**: Base agent class with session management and client factory
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Research**: Likely (Claude Agent SDK session patterns, agent lifecycle)
**Research topics**: SDK session creation, agent lifecycle management, client configuration
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 3: Planner Agent
**Goal**: Agent that decomposes tasks into implementation steps
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Research**: Unlikely (internal prompt engineering, established planning patterns)
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 4: Coder Agent
**Goal**: Agent that implements code based on plans with file operations
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Research**: Unlikely (file I/O patterns, established in foundation)
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 5: Reviewer Agent
**Goal**: Agent that validates implementations against requirements
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Research**: Unlikely (validation logic, established patterns)
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 6: Orchestration
**Goal**: Handoff patterns and agent workflow coordination
**Depends on**: Phases 3, 4, 5
**Research**: Likely (agent coordination patterns, workflow design)
**Research topics**: Multi-agent patterns, handoff protocols, error handling in workflows
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 7: Example Task
**Goal**: End-to-end demonstration with a simple coding task
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Research**: Unlikely (applying established patterns)
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 8: Documentation
**Goal**: Pattern documentation and code cleanup
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Research**: Unlikely (documentation and cleanup)
**Plans**: TBD

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute in numeric order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8
