# Milestone v0.3: File Writing Fix

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-17
**Phases:** 12
**Total Plans:** 1

## Overview

Close the loop on multi-agent workflow by implementing actual file operations — CoderAgent writes files to workspace, ReviewerAgent reads actual source code.

## Phases

### Phase 12: File Writing Implementation

**Goal**: Implement actual file operations in CoderAgent (write to workspace) and ReviewerAgent (read actual files)
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Research**: Unlikely (internal filesystem operations, established patterns)
**Plans**: 1/1 Complete ✅

Plans:
- [x] 12-01: File writing implementation - CoderAgent.applyFileChanges(), ReviewerAgent file reading, SequentialOrchestrator coordination

**Details:**

File operations implemented in agents (not just utilities) for clarity and separation of concerns. Workspace path passed as optional parameter to maintain backward compatibility. Reviewer input simplified to task + plan only (reads actual files independently). SequentialOrchestrator coordinates the workflow without handling file operations directly.

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**

None

**Key Decisions:**

- File operations implemented in agents (not just utilities) for clarity and separation of concerns
- Workspace path passed as optional parameter to maintain backward compatibility
- Reviewer input simplified to task + plan only (reads actual files independently)
- SequentialOrchestrator coordinates the workflow without handling file operations directly
- CodeResult.filesWritten field tracks actual files written to workspace

**Issues Resolved:**

- Multi-agent workflow now has complete file operation capability
- PlannerAgent creates plan, CoderAgent writes actual source files to workspace, ReviewerAgent reviews actual source code
- Complete cycle from task to reviewed code

**Issues Deferred:**

None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None - implementation is clean and follows established patterns
